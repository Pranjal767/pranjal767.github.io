# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my **personal portfolio website** built using **HTML and CSS**.  
It showcases my background, interests, and projects as I begin my journey in web development and computer science.

## 💡 About the Project
This is my first ever web project — designed and coded from scratch to learn the fundamentals of HTML structure and CSS styling.  
It includes:
- Responsive landing page layout  
- About and contact sections  
- Smooth design elements and clean typography  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Structuring a website using semantic HTML  
- Styling with CSS (layouts, flexbox, spacing, and responsive design)  
- Organizing files for a real-world project  

---

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add JavaScript interactivity (animations, contact form validation)  
- Learn and use Tailwind CSS or frameworks like React for upcoming projects  
- Continue improving the design and content as I grow
